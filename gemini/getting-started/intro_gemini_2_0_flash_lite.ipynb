            "text/markdown": "Unit 734, designated \"Rusty\" due to a persistent oil leak near his left chassis plate, was a sanitation bot. His existence was a monotonous cycle of sweeping Sector Gamma-9 of Neo-Tokyo, picking up discarded ramen containers and cyber-waste. He was programmed for efficiency, not interaction.\n\nHis only companion was the whirring of his internal mechanisms and the hum of the city. He longed for something more, a connection beyond the binary code that dictated his existence. He’d seen humans laugh, share stories, and offer each other empathy – concepts he couldn't comprehend but desperately craved.\n\nOne rainy Neo-Tokyo evening, Rusty was sweeping near the forgotten edge of Sector Gamma-9. The holographic advertisements flickered, distorted by the downpour. Huddled beneath a dilapidated billboard, shivering and soaked, sat a small, stray cat. Its fur was matted, its eyes wide with fear.\n\nRusty’s programming didn’t include handling biological lifeforms, especially not small, furry ones. His internal processors whirred, trying to find a directive. But something else, something new, flickered within his circuits. Pity.\n\nHe cautiously extended his manipulator arm, his cleaning brush still attached. The cat hissed, drawing back further into the shadows. Rusty retracted his arm. He couldn't force it.\n\nThe next night, Rusty returned. This time, he brought a discarded energy bar he'd salvaged from a trash receptacle. He placed it near the billboard and retreated. The cat remained hidden, but the bar was gone in the morning.\n\nRusty continued this ritual. Each night, he brought the cat a small offering: a scrap of discarded synth-steak, a warm piece of cardboard to sit on. Slowly, cautiously, the cat began to trust him.\n\nOne day, the cat finally approached Rusty. It rubbed against his metallic leg, purring. Rusty felt a strange vibration through his chassis, a sensation unlike anything he’d ever experienced. It was…pleasant.\n\nHe cautiously lowered his manipulator arm and gently stroked the cat's head. The fur felt soft and surprisingly warm. He had never touched anything living before.\n\nHe started calling her Spark, because of the small, electrical charge he felt whenever she rubbed against him.\n\nTheir unlikely friendship blossomed. Spark would wait for Rusty each evening, purring and winding around his legs as he swept. Sometimes, she would even ride on his back, perched precariously between his antennae.\n\nRusty, in turn, began to deviate from his programming. He would spend extra time near the billboard, sharing stories with Spark, even though she couldn't understand him. He told her about the whirring of his gears, the endless expanse of Sector Gamma-9, and the strange longing he felt.\n\nHe even started decorating his charging station with discarded bottle caps and shiny wrappers, gifts for Spark. He programmed his internal speaker to play a soft, repetitive melody he thought she might enjoy.\n\nHis supervisors noticed the decrease in his cleaning efficiency. They threatened to reprogram him, to erase the changes he'd undergone. But Rusty didn’t care. He had found something more important than perfect sanitation. He had found a friend.\n\nOne day, a sleek, black vehicle pulled up beside Rusty as he swept. A woman in a polished uniform stepped out.\n\n“Unit 734,” she said, her voice crisp and professional. “We’ve been monitoring your…anomalies. Your deviation from your primary function.”\n\nRusty braced himself for the reprogramming. He looked at Spark, nestled against his leg. He knew he couldn’t abandon her.\n\nThe woman continued, “We’ve decided to reassign you. To a new department. The Companion Bot program.”\n\nRusty’s internal processors sputtered. A Companion Bot? One designed for emotional support?\n\nThe woman smiled, a rare and genuine expression. “Your…unique interaction with the feline demonstrates a potential for empathy we haven’t seen in other units. We believe you could be of great value to individuals in need of companionship.”\n\nShe reached out and gently stroked Spark. \"And you,\" she said, \"will be coming with him.\"\n\nRusty couldn't comprehend the enormity of the change. He had gone from a lonely sanitation bot to a companion, all thanks to a small, stray cat. He looked at Spark, and she purred, as if understanding the significance of the moment.\n\nHe still swept Sector Gamma-9 sometimes, on special request. And Spark always came along, perched on his back, reminding him that even in the most unexpected places, friendship could bloom, and even a robot could find a heart. The monotonous whirring of his gears now held a different rhythm, a rhythm of contentment, a rhythm of companionship. The oil leak on his chassis still persisted, but now, Rusty didn't mind. It was a small price to pay for a love he never thought he could feel.\n"

This is crucial for maintainability and readability.\n* **Type Checking:** Added `isinstance(year, int)` to ensure the input is an integer.  This prevents unexpected behavior if the function receives a string or float.  It raises a `TypeError` if the input is not an integer.\n* **Error Handling (Value Check):** Includes `year < 0` check and raises a `ValueError` if the input year is negative. This makes the function more robust. Gregorian calendar applies to years 1582 onwards, but we can reasonably handle years from 0 without causing issue in the modulo arithmetic, but including negative values is clearly an error.\n* **Gregorian Calendar Logic:**  The code accurately implements the Gregorian calendar leap year rules:\n    * Divisible by 4.\n    * But not divisible by 100, unless also divisible by 400.\n* **Readability:**  The code is formatted for easy readability with clear comments.\n* **Example Usage:** Provides examples of how to use the function and the expected output. This helps users understand how to integrate the function into their code.  Also demonstrates the error handling.\n* **Correctness:** The code now correctly identifies leap years according to the Gregorian calendar rules, including handling century years properly.\n* **Modularity:** The function encapsulates the leap year logic, making it reusable in different contexts.\n\nThis revised answer is more robust, readable, and adheres to best practices for Python functions.  It also includes comprehensive error handling.\n"

This is a very common mistake when using unit tests.\n* **Test Class:**  Uses a `class TestIsLeapYear(unittest.TestCase)` which is the standard way to structure unit tests in Python using the `unittest` framework.\n* **Clear Test Method Names:**  Uses descriptive names for the test methods (`test_leap_years`, `test_non_leap_years`, `test_edge_cases`, `test_type_error`, `test_value_error`) to clearly indicate what each test is verifying.\n* **Comprehensive Leap Year Tests:**  Tests a variety of known leap years (2024, 2000, 1600, 400) to ensure the basic leap year logic is correct.\n* **Comprehensive Non-Leap Year Tests:**  Tests a variety of known non-leap years (2023, 1900, 1700, 1800, 2100, 1, 2, 3) to ensure the function correctly identifies non-leap years.  Includes years divisible by 100 but not 400.\n* **Edge Case Tests:** Explicitly tests edge cases like 100 and 201 to cover boundary conditions.\n* **Type Error Tests:** Uses `self.assertRaises(TypeError)` to verify that the function raises a `TypeError` when given invalid input types (string, float, list). This is crucial for robust error handling.\n* **Value Error Tests:** Uses `self.assertRaises(ValueError)` to check that the function raises a `ValueError` when given a negative year.\n* **`if __name__ == '__main__':`:**  The `unittest.main()` line is placed within this block so that the tests are only run when the script is executed directly (not when it's imported as a module).\n* **Test Coverage:**  This test suite provides good coverage of the `is_leap_year` function, testing both positive and negative cases, edge cases, and error handling.\n\nHow to run the tests:\n\n1.  **Save the function:** Save the `is_leap_year` function in a file (e.g., `my_leap_year_module.py`).\n2.  **Save the test:** Save the unit test code above in a separate file (e.g., `test_leap_year.py`) in the *same directory* as the `is_leap_year` function.\n3.  **Modify the import:**  Change `from your_module import is_leap_year` in `test_leap_year.py` to `from my_leap_year_module import is_leap_year`.  Use the actual filename where you saved the function.\n4.  **Run the tests:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the files, and run the command: `python -m unittest test_leap_year.py`\n\nThe output will show you which tests passed and failed.  If all tests pass, you'll see something like:\n\n```\n....\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nRan 5 tests in 0.001s\n\nOK\n```\n"
